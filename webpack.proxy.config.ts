 * Run the forklift plugin as an overlay on top of an existing Console UI.
 * The requirement is that the plugin is already installed in the Console.
 * Key points:
 * 1. Console UI is accessed via webpack dev server proxy with all the paths unchanged
 * 2. local plugin is served via public path (see base config) which is the same as the URL used by the Console
 * 3. when the Console loads the plugin(by URL) the local version is used
